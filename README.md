# Encodex
This is a simple encoder. I created it because I wanted to encode text for myself, and really liked Base64 encoding. However, I did not love the idea that anyone could decode my strings with an online base64 decoder, or even write their own script to do it. So, I made an application that Base64 encodes it, and then encodes it further with a hardcoded key. This lets text be encoded and decoded like a normal Base64 encoder/decoder, but only this application can do it. The user also has an option to input their own encription key, which further encrypts the string, letting it be decoded only by inputting that key along with the encoded stiring.
